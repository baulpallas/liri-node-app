# liri-node-app

### Overview

This is a command line application written with node that is supposed to mimic Apple's assistant 'SIRI' in a simplistic way. The way it works is that the user inputs written commands in the terimnal and LIRI Bot returns a search result. For exemple, once in the correct directory the user enters 'node liri.js' and one of the following commands followed by their search criteria.

- concert-this: searches for concerts occuring soon based on the user's search criteria and returns a list of concerts
- movie-this: searches for movies and returns aspects about the movie (title, release year, actors, etc)
- spotify-this-song: searches for songs on spotify and returns aspects like track name, album, etc.
- do-what-it-says: uses node to parse information in a .txt file and follow the stated command.
